    /// ⓘ Info: With regards to a hosted application, there is a caching mechanism in place that keeps the information about the placement of application files (html, javascript, css, fonts, etc.). Removing a hosted application, in normal circumstances, will cause the subsequent requests for application files to fail with an HTTP 404 error because the application is removed synchronously, its files are immediately removed on the node serving the request and at the same time the information is propagated to other nodes – but in rare cases there might be a delay with this propagation. In such situations, the files of the removed application can be served from those nodes up until the aforementioned cache expires. For the same reason, the cache can also cause HTTP 404 errors when the application is updated as it will keep the path to the files of the old version of the application. The cache is filled on demand, so there should not be issues if application files were not accessed prior to the delete request. The expiration delay of the cache can differ, but should not take more than one minute. <br />
