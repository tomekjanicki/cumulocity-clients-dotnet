change api methods which returns Task<System.IO.Stream> - currently stream is not readable and causes errors
1. when "Accept" is "application/zip", "application/octet-stream" return signature should be Task<byte[]>
2. when "Accept" is "application/json" return signature should be Task<string>
or alternativly configure proper streaming

3. for create and for update endpoints (i.e. CreateAlarm, UpdateAlarm) - always object should be created, not null - in case when even null is passed, we should create empty object
4. for collections (i.e. GetAlarms) - always object should be created, not null - in case when even null is passed, we should create empty object
