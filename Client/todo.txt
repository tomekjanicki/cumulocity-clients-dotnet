change api methods which returns Task<System.IO.Stream> - currently stream is not readable and causes errors
1. when "Accept" is "application/zip", "application/octet-stream" return signature should be Task<byte[]>
2. when "Accept" is "application/json" return signature should be Task<string>
or alternativly configure proper streaming
